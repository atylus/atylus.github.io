## Overview

Pinalog Spatial: Container is an intelligent 3D loading engine that revolutionizes freight logistics. By calculating optimal packing arrangements for varied cargo, it maximizes volumetric efficiency while ensuring load stability—solving one of the most complex problems in global shipping.

### The Challenge

Container loading is a multidimensional optimization problem:

- **Volume Maximization**: Pack as much cargo as possible
- **Weight Distribution**: Maintain stability and safety
- **Cargo Protection**: Prevent damage during transport
- **Loading Order**: Optimize for delivery sequence
- **Constraint Handling**: Account for fragile items, weight limits, and stacking rules

Manual planning is time-consuming and suboptimal, often leaving 20-30% of container space unused.

### Our Solution

We developed a physics-based 3D engine that:

1. **3D Cargo Analysis**: Scans and models all items to be loaded
2. **Genetic Algorithm Optimization**: Tests millions of packing permutations
3. **Physics Simulation**: Validates stability and safety of each arrangement
4. **Constraint Management**: Respects all real-world loading rules
5. **Visual Loading Guide**: Generates step-by-step 3D loading instructions

### Technical Innovation

- **Custom Physics Engine**: Real-time stability calculations for complex cargo arrangements
- **Multi-objective Optimization**: Balances space utilization, weight distribution, and loading efficiency
- **Constraint Solver**: Handles dozens of simultaneous loading constraints
- **3D Visualization**: Interactive preview of optimal loading sequence

### Results

- **92% average space utilization** (industry average: 70%)
- **35% reduction** in loading time
- **Zero stability incidents** since deployment
- **$1.2M annual savings** for pilot client
- **Handles 200+ items** per container in under 3 seconds

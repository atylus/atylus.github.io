## Overview

Pinalog Spatial: Warehouse transforms warehouse management through browser-based 3D visualization. This digital twin system utilizes Three.js and machine learning to simulate optimal shelving strategies and real-time stock movement, dramatically reducing spatial waste and improving operational efficiency.

### The Challenge

Traditional warehouse management systems operate in 2D, making it difficult to:

- Visualize optimal space utilization
- Plan for changing inventory compositions
- Simulate different shelving strategies
- Track stock movement in real-time
- Identify spatial inefficiencies

### Our Solution

We created a browser-based 3D digital twin that:

1. **Real-time 3D Visualization**: Photorealistic warehouse rendering using Three.js and WebGL
2. **ML-Powered Optimization**: Machine learning algorithms suggest optimal shelving strategies
3. **Stock Movement Simulation**: Predict and visualize inventory flow patterns
4. **Spatial Analytics**: Identify wasted space and bottlenecks
5. **Browser-Based Access**: No installation required—accessible from any device

### Technical Innovation

- **WebGL Performance**: Optimized rendering for complex warehouse environments with 100,000+ items
- **Machine Learning Integration**: TensorFlow.js models run directly in the browser
- **Real-time Sync**: Live data integration with existing WMS systems
- **Responsive 3D**: Smooth performance on desktop and tablet devices

### Results

- **40% reduction** in spatial waste
- **25% improvement** in picking efficiency
- **60% faster** warehouse layout planning
- **Zero installation** barrier—instant browser access
- **Real-time visibility** across all warehouse operations
